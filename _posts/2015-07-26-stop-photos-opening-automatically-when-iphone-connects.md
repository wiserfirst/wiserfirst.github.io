excerpt: Prevent an annoying behaviour that happens automatically on Mac
---

When connecting an iPhone to your Mac, the Photos app will open automatically by
default, which could sometimes be pretty annoying. So here is how to prevent
that:

1. Connect the iPhone to the Mac and let Photos app launch itself as usual
2. Under the "Import" tab of Photos app, look in the upper left corner to find
   the device name, this will indicate which iPhone (or hardware) will no longer
   automatically activate Photos app
3. Click the checkbox so that "Open Photos for this device" is no longer
   selected (likewise, toggling this on would enable Photos app to open itself
   again automatically when this device is connected)
4. Quit out of Photos app, the change is immediate for that device â€“ this can be
   switched back at any time in the same OS X Photos app screen
