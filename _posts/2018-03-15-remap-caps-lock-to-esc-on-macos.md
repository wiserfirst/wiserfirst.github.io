As a Vim user, I always want to remap Caps Lock to ESC on my Mac computers. In
the past, this required a third party app named Seil and more info in [this
StackOverflow question]. But as another answer for the same question pointed
out, since macOS Sierra (10.12), this can be done natively in System Preferences
-> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys:
