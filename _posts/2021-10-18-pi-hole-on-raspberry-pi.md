excerpt: Install in one place and protect your entire network
---

According to its official documentation,

> The Pi-holeÂ® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted
> content, without installing any client-side software.

Pi-hole is a great piece of software if you are interested in a bit more privacy
and saving some bandwidth at the same time.

As its name suggests, it can obviously be installed on a Raspberry Pi, but apart
from that it actually runs on other Linux hardware as well. As long as your
device can run one of the [Officially supported Operating Systems][official os],
you should be able to run Pi-hole on it.

While supporting other hardware definitely has its use cases, I consider
Raspberry Pi to be the best choice for running Pi-hole in the home network,
because of its low cost and very low power consumption.

I happen to have a [Raspberry Pi Zero][pi-zero] that's been collecting dust
since I bought it a few years ago, which is perfect for running Pi-hole.

## Install OS on Raspberry Pi

Obviously we need to install an operating system on Raspberry Pi before we could
do anything with it.

The recommended way of installing an operating system for Raspberry Pi is to use
the [Raspberry Pi Imager][pi-imager]. You'll need a computer with an micro SD
card reader to install an OS image on your card.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

I'm running it on macOS, but it supports Linux and Windows as well. Just make
sure to download the correct version for your OS.

Click `CHOOSE OS` to choose from a list of options. I'd recommended just go with
`Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)`, which is the first option, unless you have a
specific purpose for the Pi and you know what you are doing.

Then click `CHOOSE STORAGE` to select the mounted micro SD card. Remember that
the imager will erase the card first, so you'll lost everything on the card.
Make sure you've got backup for anything you still need on the card.

Lastly, click `WRITE` to install the selected OS on your card.

For most of the OS options, the imager will download the OS image while writing
it to the micro SD card. If you have a slow Internet connect, you can also
download the OS image separately from [here][os-download] and then choose `Use
custom` for the OS option and select the downloaded `.img` file.

### Advanced options for the imager

There is also an "Advanced" menu in the imager, which you can open with
`Ctrl-Shift-X`. This menu allows you to perform tasks like enabling SSH and
setting admin password. As described in the next section, we can do those with
terminal commands too.

## Setup Raspberry Pi

Since I find connecting a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse to the Raspberry Pi
quite cumbersome, I'd like to setup a headless Raspberry Pi.

In order to achieve that, there are a couple more things to do before booting
the Raspberry Pi: enable SSH access and allow auto WiFi connection.

### Enable SSH access

On macOS, the SD card with Raspberry Pi OS image is usually mounted on
`/Volumes/boot`.

We can enable SSH by creating an empty file named `ssh` in the root directory of
the card:

```sh
cd /Volumes/boot
touch ssh
```

### Auto WiFi connection

I'd also like the Pi to be able to connect to WiFi when it boots up.

In order to do that, create a text file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with the
following content:

```plaintext
country=<your-country-code>
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
    ssid="<your-wifi-ssid>"
    psk="<your-wifi-psk"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Obviously, fill in the [ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code][iso3166] of your country,
your WiFi SSID and PSK.

Then copy the file to the root directory of the SD card:

```sh
cp wpa_supplicant.conf /Volumes/boot
```

> Note: if you are using an older Raspberry Pi (like my Pi Zero), it might not
> support 5GHz networks

### Connect via SSH

After the two steps above, we can put the SD card in the Raspberry Pi and boot
it up.

Once it's up and running, we should be able to connect to it via SSH:

```sh
ssh pi@<ip_for_raspberry_pi>
```

The default password is `raspberry`.

Make sure to update the admin password with `passed` after logging in.

### Fix locale

When you run commands on the Raspberry Pi, you may see warnings like this

> -bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)

So you might want to fix the locale.

If you are comfortable with `vi` or `nano`, just edit `/etc/locale.gen` and
uncomment the line starting with `en_US.UTF-8`.

Otherwise you can run the following command to do the same:

```sh
perl -pi -e 's/# en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/g' /etc/locale.gen
```

Then run the following:

```sh
locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
update-locale en_US.UTF-8
```

After that, the annoying warnings should be gone.

Check out [Jared Wolff's post][locale-post] for more details on locale.

## Install Pi-hole

Now the Raspberry Pi is in a reasonable state, we are ready to install Pi-hole.

The most convenient way to is to use the following command:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

The installation process is relatively straightforward. Just follow the prompts
to get it done.

If you'd like to know what the installation script actually does, check out the
source code [basic-install.sh][].

### Take advantage of Pi-hole in the network

After Pi-hole is successfully installed, we still need to configure the router
to use Pi-hole as the DNS server, which makes sure that all devices on the
network will be protected automatically by Pi-hole.

If that's not supported by your router or you only want certain devices to use
Pi-hole, you can configure the DNS server on each device.

You might want to check out [this comprehensive guide][config pi hole as dns
server] on the different options to configure Pi-hole as your DNS server.

### Manage blocklists

Pi-hole comes with a default blocklist:

```plaintext
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts
```

Which is well maintained and provides good protection without breaking normal
functionality in most cases. For many this might be enough, but if you have
other requirements, such as blocking adult content or targeted ads, you can add
custom blocklists for improved blocking capabilities.

Check out [The Best PiHole Blocklists (2021)][best-pihole-blocklists] for some
blocklist options and more importantly, what to think about when choosing a
blocklist.

You can add/remove blocklists under `Group Management -> Adlists` in the Pi-hole
admin interface. After making changes there, you'll need to either run `pihole
-g` in terminal or go to `Tools -> Update Gravity` and click the `Update`
button.

### Whitelist Youtube history and etc

With the default blocklist from Pi-hole, the only thing that no longer works for
me is Youtube history on iOS devices.

Adding a domain to the whitelist would solve that:

```sh
pihole -w s.youtube.com
```

Or if you prefer the admin interface, you can add a domain in `Whitelist`.

If you find other sites or services not working properly after introducing
Pi-hole, you might want to check out the [Commonly Whitelisted Domains][] and
potentially whitelist relevant domains.

## Keep software up-to-date

Last but not least, keeping things up-to-date on the Raspberry Pi would be a
good idea.

Since Raspberry Pi OS is based on Debian Linux, we can use `apt` for that:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Also we can remove packages that are no longer required with:

```sh
sudo apt autoremove
```

## Summary

In this post, I walked through how to install Raspberry Pi OS, setup headless
Raspberry Pi, install Pi-hole, manage blocklists and etc.

As many of my other posts, the main purpose is to serve as a reference for my
future self. But if someone else finds it helpful too, I'd be very glad
