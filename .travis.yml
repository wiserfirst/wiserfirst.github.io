        # Explanations for flags:
        # --allow-hash-href - Build will fail on the first and last post entries
        # if this isn't allowed since there will be previous and next buttons
        # that have 'links to nowhere'.
        # --assume-extension - Jekyll 3 supports extensionless URLs, and
        # the blog uses them, so this flag needs to be here to prevent errors.
        # --url-ignore "/localhost/" - Posts have explicit references to
        # localhost, so don't consider them proper external links that need to
        # go anywhere.
        # --http-status-ignore "999" - LinkedIn doesn't seem to like crawlers,
        # and hence sends back 999 errors, even if the link is valid.
        # --disable-external - Only use this if the build fails unreasonably on
        # external links
        # NOTE: If a new post is created or new tags are introduced via a post,
        # htmlproofer will need to be disabled for a build in order to proceed
        # forward
